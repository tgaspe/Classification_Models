# Stats Project

## Overview
This project, was conducted by Theodoro Gasperin Terra Camargo and Tarek Chammaa El Rifai Mashmoushi as part of the Statistical Methods for Bioinformatics class at KU Leuven. The project's primary goal was to analyze a medical dataset with 102 columns (101 predictor variables and 1 response variable) using various statistical and machine learning models to make classification predictions about the state of patients (either alive or dead), particularly focusing on model performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.

## How to Run
* Load the dataset by placing MI.RData in the project directory.
* Run the R script provided to perform data exploration, imputation, and model fitting.
* Evaluate model performance and compare results using the provided ROC curve plots and confusion matrices.
#### Dependencies
* R (version 4.0 or higher)
* Packages: mice, caret, glmnet, dplyr, gam, randomForest, pROC
